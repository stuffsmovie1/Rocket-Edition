= Bill: Hi there, [player].\nIt's been a while.\pFill me in on the latest Rocket\nnews, if you would.\pOh, now!\c\h08� The little kid\nknocked you all senseless?\pHahahaha! Sorry, but I find that\nrather humorous. Some kid!\pOh, and what?\c\h08� Giovanni finally\nrevealed his wartime secrets?\pGood. Then we're fully on the same\npage, now, aren't we?\pI suppose he told you about[.]\c\h08�\n"The Catastrophe" as well, then?\p[.]\pYes, yes, that Mewtwo is well shut\noff in Cerulean Cave.\pBut I'm curious[.]\c\h08� did he happen to\nknow what became of Mew after the\lproject was shut down?\p[.]\c\h08�\nNo? Very well.\pKeep up the good work, [player].\nYou're a good friend to have.\pI'll talk to you later.
