= Bill: Hey, [player], it's me.\nHaven't heard from you in a while.\pNo major new Rocket events to\nreport? No Silph Co. scoop?\c\h08ï¿½\Fine.\pI'm just calling to tell you I\npassed on one of the gifts you\lgave me from before.\pJust a little while ago some young\nhotshot Trainer kid stopped by my\lhouse and helped me with some\lexperimental hiccups.\pThe kid didn't say \nanything, but\lhe was more intense and focused\lthan any kid Trainer I've ever\lseen-- it was funny.\pEleven years old, and he had\nalready got two Gym Badges!\pSo I gave him my ticket to board\nthe S.S. Anne.\pJust thought you might like to\nknow. Talk to you later.
