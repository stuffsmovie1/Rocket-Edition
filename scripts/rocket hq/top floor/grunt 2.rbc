= Heh, you going out to steal your\nfirst Pok�mon, are you?\pTake note: as a grunt you only\nhave authority enough to steal\lfrom children and old people.\pTry anyone else and they'll just\nblow you off!

#org @talk2
= What are you looking at, punk?\nWant a piece of me?\p[.]\pHaha[.] what? Just practicing my\ntough-guy demeanor.


#org @talk3
= Surely I'm not the only one who\nfinds it funny that the cops are\lrewarding me for being nice[.]\pOnly because I was bad before[.]\c\h08�\n[.]\pLike, I just feel like there's\nsome moral contradiction here, but\lI just can't put my finger on it[.]
