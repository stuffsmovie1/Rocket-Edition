#org @blaitalk3

= Blaine: Listen, now!\pFuji knows all you guys have been\ndoing up in the Pok�mon Tower, and\lhe's gone into a crazy fit over\lit!\pJust yesterday he sent an angry\nemail to all his old colleagues at\lthe Pok�mon Lab, warning them\lthat, I quote:


#org @blaitalk4
= "Team Rocket is up to no good!\pThey've got spies all over, and\nthey're ruthless!\pBe on the lookout for any\nsuspicious activity!"


#org @blaitalk5

#org @blaitalk6
= You know I'll always support what\nyou guys are doing here[.]\pBut I'm not gonna risk my position\nas a Gym Leader for Team Rocket,\lall right?\pI'll have to lay low for a while.



#org @bosstalk21

= Giovanni: God damn you, Blaine[.]\pDo you even realize what a major\nsource of revenue Porygon is for\lour Game Corner?\pPlayers just won't want to gamble\nas much if they don't have the\lprospect of winning one dangled in\lfront of them.


#org @bosstalk22

= Christ.\pAnd where else do you suggest we\nget our Porygon supply-- at the\lPok� Mart?\pThere's only a handful of\nscientists in Kanto who'd be\lwilling or even able to make the\lthings, let alone help us\ldistribute them illegally.


#org @blaitalk7
= Blaine: Maybe[.]\c\h08�\nLook, it's been over a decade[.]\pI know you're not keen on the\nidea, but how about we see if\lmaybe Professor Oak would be\lwilling to hel--


#org @NO

#org @bosstalk23Extra

#org @blaitalk8

#org @blaitalk9

= Blaine: (sigh[.])\c\h08�\nWell, then[.]\pI suggest you talk to Bill about\nit.\pHe's an unpredictable kid, but\nhe's smart, and I'll bet you\lanything he nicked himself a copy\lof the Porygon from me or Fuji\lback in the day.\pHe should be more than apt for the\njob.


#org @bosstalk24

= Giovanni: Hmph.\pWell, I don't suppose we have much\nof a choice.\pBill has done a couple of smaller\ntech-related jobs for us in the\lpast, but he's a fickle kid, and I\ldon't like him.\pPlus, he always demands ridiculous\ncompensation for everything he\ldoes, the rascal.


#org @bosstalk25
= But[.] seeing as he's our only hope\nright now[.]\pI suppose he'll do.


#org @ellipses
= Giovanni: [.]\c\h08�

#org @bosstalk26

= I'm letting you off the hook for\nnow, Blaine-- for old time's sake.\pBut if you hinder Team Rocket's\noperations again[.]\pWell[.]\c\h08� you're not going to get a\nfavorable outcome.\pIs that clear?


#org @bosstalkExtra
= I expect you to be back making\nPorygon for us again once this\lwhole Fuji business blows over.

#org @blaitalk10
= Blaine: Yes, Giovanni.\c\h08�\nThank you.

#org @bosstalk27
= Giovanni: [player], over here.\nI have a new mission for you.

#org @bosstalk28

= Here's what I want you to do now,\nlisten carefully:\pYou're going to go to Bill's\nhouse, just north of Cerulean.\pYou're going to offer him a job,\non behalf of Team Rocket, as a\ltemporary manufacturer of Porygon.\pIf he says no, tell him we'll make\nhim an offer he can't refuse.\pTell him he can name any price or\nservice he likes[.] within reason.


#org @bosstalk29
= Another squad of grunts should be\nheaded for Cerulean on another\lmission right about now as well.\pI suggest you rendezvous with them\nin the secret Rocket base we've\lstationed just south of the city.\pThe Rocket admin there should be\nable to give you a few rare items\lto tempt Bill with as well.


#org @bosstalk30
= Is that clear?\c\h08�\nWell, on with you, then!\pI'm counting on you, [player]!
